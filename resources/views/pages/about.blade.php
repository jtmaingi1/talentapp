      <p class="text-justify"> This is a project geared towards identifying, appreciating and nurturing talent in Kenya. The major beneficiaries are children from age of 3, the time they join schools to the age of 18 years where they now become citizens. Many talents go wasted, others unknown and worse of it many never get to be or do whatever they ever desired to be. Below is a project proposal to be carried forward.  Many Kenyans live under one dollar meal a day, thus many children are taxed with other responsibilities e.g being early parents in the sense that they take care of their younger ones thus do not even value what is in them as much as what they must do for their siblings. Another category of children are those that are neglected by their very own parents due to the hardship of life, many end up in the streets, others look for labour to do so as to feed their stomachs while others sink into self-inferiority and cannot identify with the reality of who they really are.</p>
      <p class="text-justify">Another major category are children in the rural areas, many are not exposed, many have only known one way of life according to the culture, society norms and only what is available in their environment.   
        By coming together as donors, well-wishers, volunteers and in any way that one feels can be a blessing to our very own children, we identify the talent in them and build them through the process. This will lead to transformation of our future generation. By cultivating that inborn talent, we encourage diversity and inclusion, we harbor more talent,  we boost the self-esteem of our children and most importantly their talent is never lost.
