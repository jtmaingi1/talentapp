      <p class="text-justify"> This is a project geared towards identifying, appreciating and nurturing talent in Kenya. The major beneficiaries are children from age of 3 to 18yrs, from the time they join schools to adult age. Many talents go wasted, others unknown and worse of it many may never get to realise the potential God placed within them. </p>
      <p class="text-justify"> Consequently, I Got Talent website has been launched and it's projects will be carried out across the nation of Kenya seeking to address the following issues, to ensure the potential that God placed in us and our Children is well utilized for the benefit of their families and the society as a whole.</p>
      <p class="text-justify"> Many Kenyans who live under one dollar meal a day, are the main target beneficiary group of I Got Talent. We recognise that in many of these target group families, the children are taxed with other responsibilities e.g being early parents in the sense that they take care of their younger ones thus do not even value what is in them as much as what they must do for their siblings. Another category of children are those that are neglected by their very own parents due to the hardship of life, many end up in the streets, others look for labour to do so as to feed their stomachs while others sink into self-inferiority and cannot identify with the reality of who they really are.</p>
      <p class="text-justify">Another major category are children in the rural areas, many are not exposed, many have only known one way of life according to the culture, society norms and only what is available in their environment.   
        By coming together as donors, well-wishers, volunteers and in any way that one feels can be a blessing to our very own children, we can all together identify the talent in them, build, and support them through the process to realise the potential Almighty God placed in them. This will lead to transformation of our future generation to become more productive. By cultivating that inborn talent, we encourage diversity and inclusivity, we harbor more talent,  we boost the self-esteem of our children and most importantly talent is never lost.
